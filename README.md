# MyReads Project

This is a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. Also you can search and add new books to your collection.


## Installation

Please run this at the root directory of the project.
```
https://github.com/AbdelrahmanAbdelrazek/MyReads.git
npm install
npm run
```

## Notes

The search from BooksAPI is limited to a particular set of search terms. You can find these search terms here:
https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/blob/master/SEARCH_TERMS.md

However, remember that the BooksAPI.search method DOES search by title or author. So, don't worry if you don't find a specific author or title. Every search is limited by search terms.
